# ReactApplication
I have made a simple react application, which has 2 views.
The user is able to navigate from the first view to the second view using 
a button on the screen. The user can go back to the first view using the back button
on the upper left of the screen.

The coding aspect of the application wasn't too dificult and there were many tutorials 
that showed how to use react navigation. After I got the project running, 
I created a stack navigator for the project and added
two screens a home screen and second page and added them to the stack. After the two screen were
created, I added a button that would link to the second page to the home page. I then changed 
the styling on the pages to make it look nicer.

I found the hardest part of the project was setting up the application.I had to install
many different applications and programs and I also had to learn how to use the react CLI.
There were many little issues with dependancies I had to figure out to actual get my project
running on the simulator.
How I solved this problem was being very careful about following the recommended 
installtion steps.
